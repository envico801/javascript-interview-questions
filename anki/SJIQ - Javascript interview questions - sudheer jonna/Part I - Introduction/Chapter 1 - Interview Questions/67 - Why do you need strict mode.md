==================== Question ====================  

### Why do you need strict mode  

==================== Answer ====================  

Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax"
into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global
variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a
non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a
non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.
