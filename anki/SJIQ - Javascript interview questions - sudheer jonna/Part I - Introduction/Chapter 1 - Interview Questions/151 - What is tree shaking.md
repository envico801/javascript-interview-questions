========== Question ==========  

### What is tree shaking  

========== Answer ==========  

Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules
will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it
relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and
export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler
`rollup`.
