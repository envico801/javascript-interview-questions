==================== Question ====================  

### What is an event table  

==================== Answer ====================  

Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events
which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the
resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or
invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.  
It doesn't not execute functions on itâ€™s own. The main purpose of the event
table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in
the below diagram.
