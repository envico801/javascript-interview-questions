========== Question ==========  

### Is PostMessage secure  

========== Answer ==========  

Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.
