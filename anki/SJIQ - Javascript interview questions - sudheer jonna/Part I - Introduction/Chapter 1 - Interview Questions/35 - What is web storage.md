Q: What is web storage  
A: Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.
1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.
