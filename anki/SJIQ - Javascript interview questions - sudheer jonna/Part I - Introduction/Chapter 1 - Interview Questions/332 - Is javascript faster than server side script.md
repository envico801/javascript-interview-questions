Q: Is JavaScript faster than server side script  
A: Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web serverâ€™s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.
