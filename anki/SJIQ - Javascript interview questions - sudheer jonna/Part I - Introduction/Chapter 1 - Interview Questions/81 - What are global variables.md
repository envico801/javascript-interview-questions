### What are global variables  

==================== Answer ====================  

Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code
without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if
you omit it then it will become global variable

```javascript
msg = 'Hello'; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
```
