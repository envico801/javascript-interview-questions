==================== Question ====================  

### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language  

==================== Answer ====================  

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter
in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs
it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT)
compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is
about to run.
