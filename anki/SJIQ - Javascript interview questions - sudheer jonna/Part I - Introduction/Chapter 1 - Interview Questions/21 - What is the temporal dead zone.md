==================== Question ====================  

### What is the Temporal Dead Zone  

==================== Answer ====================  

The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a
variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6,
accessing a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration (within its scope)
causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation
of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.  
Let's see this behavior with an example,

```javascript
function somemethod() {
  console.log(counter1); // undefined
  console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
  var counter1 = 1;
  let counter2 = 2;
}
```
