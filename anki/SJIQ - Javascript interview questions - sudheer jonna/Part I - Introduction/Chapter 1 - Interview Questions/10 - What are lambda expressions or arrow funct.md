========== Question ==========  

### What are lambda expressions or arrow functions  

========== Answer ==========  

An arrow function is a shorter/concise syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

Some of the examples of arrow functions are listed as below,

```javascript
const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b; // Multiple parameters
const arrowFunc2 = (a) => a * 10; // Single parameter
const arrowFunc3 = () => {}; // no parameters
```

========== Id ==========
