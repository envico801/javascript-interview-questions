==================== Question ====================  

### What is the output of below string expression  

==================== Answer ====================  

```javascript
console.log('Welcome to JS world'[0]);
```

The output of the above expression is "W".  
**Explanation:** The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns
the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns the character "W" of the
string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to
use the .charAt() method to get the desired result.
