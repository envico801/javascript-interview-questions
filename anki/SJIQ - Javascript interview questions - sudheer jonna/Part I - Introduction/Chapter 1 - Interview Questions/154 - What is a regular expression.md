Q: What is a Regular Expression  
A: A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,
```javascript
/pattern/modifiers;
```
For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,
```javascript
/John/i;
```
<!--ID: 1693596709657-->
