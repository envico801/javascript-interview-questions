==================== Question ====================  

### What is a Regular Expression  

==================== Answer ====================  

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used
to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the
syntax format now,

```javascript
     /pattern/modifiers;
```

For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive
username would be,

```javascript
/John/i;
```
