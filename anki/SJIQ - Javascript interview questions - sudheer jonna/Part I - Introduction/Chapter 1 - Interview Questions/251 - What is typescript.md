==================== Question ====================  

### What is typescript  

==================== Answer ====================  

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds
optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to
plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary
language. You can install it globally as

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

```typescript
function greeting(name: string): string {
  return 'Hello, ' + name;
}
let user = 'Sudheer';
console.log(greeting(user));
```

The greeting method allows only string type as argument.
