Q: How do you define multiline strings  
A: You can define multiline string literals using the '\\' character followed by line terminator.
```javascript
var str =
  "This is a \
very lengthy \
sentence!";
```
But if you have a space after the '\\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.
