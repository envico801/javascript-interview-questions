========== Question ==========  

### How do you define multiline strings  

========== Answer ==========  

You can define multiline string literals using the '\\' character followed by line terminator.

```javascript
var str =
    'This is a \
very lengthy \
sentence!';
```

But if you have a space after the '\\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.
