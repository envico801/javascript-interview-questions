Q: What are different event loops  
A: In JavaScript, there are multiple event loops that can be used depending on the context of your application. The most common event loops are:
1. The Browser Event Loop
2. The Node.js Event Loop
- Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP requests, and other asynchronous actions.
- The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions.
