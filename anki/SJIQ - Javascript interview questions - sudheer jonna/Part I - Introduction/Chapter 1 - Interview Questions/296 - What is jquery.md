========== Question ==========  

### What is jQuery  

========== Answer ==========  

jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document
Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions
by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its
philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome
message on the page load using jQuery as below,

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
  // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
  alert('Welcome to jQuery world');
});
```

**Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from
CDNs, like google.
