==================== Question ====================  

### What is the difference between shim and polyfill  

==================== Answer ====================  

A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only
the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web
application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older
browsers (mainly pre IE9).  
Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology
that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.  
In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.
