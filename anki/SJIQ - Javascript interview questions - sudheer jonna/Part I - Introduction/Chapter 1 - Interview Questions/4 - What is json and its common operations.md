==================== Question ====================  

### What is JSON and its common operations  

==================== Answer ====================  

**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which
was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit
data across a network. It is basically just a text file with an extension of
.json, and a MIME type of application/json  
**Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object

```javascript
JSON.parse(text);
```

**Stringification:** Converting a native object to a string so that it can be
transmitted across the network

```javascript
JSON.stringify(object);
```
