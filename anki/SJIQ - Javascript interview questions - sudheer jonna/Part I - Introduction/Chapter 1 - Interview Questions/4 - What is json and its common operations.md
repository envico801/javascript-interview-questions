Q: What is JSON and its common operations  
A: **JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json  
**Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object
```javascript
JSON.parse(text);
```
**Stringification:** converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network
```javascript
JSON.stringify(object);
```
