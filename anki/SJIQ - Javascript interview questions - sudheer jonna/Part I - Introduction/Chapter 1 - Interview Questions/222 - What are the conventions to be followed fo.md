==================== Question ====================  

### What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of switch case  

==================== Answer ====================  

Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,

1. The expression can be of type either number or string.
2. Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.
3. The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does
   not match with any case value then the statement within default case will be
   executed.
4. The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement
   sequence.
5. The break statement is optional. But if it is omitted, the execution will
   continue on into the next case.
