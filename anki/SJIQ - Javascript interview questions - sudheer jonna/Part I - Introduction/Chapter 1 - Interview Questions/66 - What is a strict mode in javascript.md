==================== Question ====================  

### What is a strict mode in javascript  

==================== Answer ====================  

Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program,
or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain
actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression
`"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict
mode.
