==================== Question ====================  

### What are lambda or arrow functions  

==================== Answer ====================  

An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not
have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best
suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.
