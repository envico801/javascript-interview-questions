Q: What is the purpose of switch-case  
A: The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,
```javascript
switch (expression)
{
case value1:
statement1;
break;
case value2:
statement2;
break;
.
.
case valueN:
statementN;
break;
default:
statementDefault;
}
```
The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
