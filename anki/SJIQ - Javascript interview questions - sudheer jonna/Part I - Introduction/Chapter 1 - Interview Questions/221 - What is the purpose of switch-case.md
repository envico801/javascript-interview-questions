==================== Question ====================  

### What is the purpose of switch-case  

==================== Answer ====================  

The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In
a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than
if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,

```javascript
     switch (expression)
     {
         case value1:
             statement1;
             break;
         case value2:
             statement2;
             break;
         .
         .
         case valueN:
             statementN;
             break;
         default:
             statementDefault;
     }
```

The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution
to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
