==================== Question ====================  

### What is an empty statement and purpose of it  

==================== Answer ====================  

The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be
executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with
an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty
statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an
empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,

```javascript
// Initialize an array a
for (let i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0);
```
