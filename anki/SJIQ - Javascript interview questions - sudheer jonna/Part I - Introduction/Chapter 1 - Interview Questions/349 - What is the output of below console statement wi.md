Q: What is the output of below console statement with unary operator  
A: Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,
```javascript
console.log(+"Hello");
```
The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.
