### What is an object initializer  

==================== Answer ====================  

An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an
Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list
of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object,
enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one
of the ways to create an object.

```javascript
var initObject = { a: 'John', b: 50, c: {} };
console.log(initObject.a); // John
```
