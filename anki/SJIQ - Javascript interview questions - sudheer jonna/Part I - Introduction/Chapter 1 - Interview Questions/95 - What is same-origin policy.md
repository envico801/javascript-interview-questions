==================== Question ====================  

### What is same-origin policy  

==================== Answer ====================  

The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests
across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme,
hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a
malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another
web page using Document Object Model(DOM).
