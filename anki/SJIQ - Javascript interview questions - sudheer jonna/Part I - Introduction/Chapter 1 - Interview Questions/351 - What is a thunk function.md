========== Question ==========  

### What is a thunk function  

========== Answer ==========  

A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesnâ€™t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const thunk = () => add(2, 3);
thunk(); // 5
```
