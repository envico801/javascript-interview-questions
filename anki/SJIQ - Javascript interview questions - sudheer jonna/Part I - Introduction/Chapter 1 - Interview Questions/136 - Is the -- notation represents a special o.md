==================== Question ====================  

### Is the !-- notation represents a special operator  

==================== Answer ====================  

No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard
operators one after the other,

1. A logical not (!)
2. A prefix decrement (--)  
   At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal
   to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.
