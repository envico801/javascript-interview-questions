Q: What is the purpose of queueMicrotask  
A: The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.  
Example:
```javascript
console.log("Start"); //1
queueMicrotask(() => {
  console.log("Inside microtask"); // 3
});
console.log("End"); //2
```
By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.
