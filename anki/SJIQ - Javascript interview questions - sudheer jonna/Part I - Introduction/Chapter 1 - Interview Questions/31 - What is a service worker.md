==================== Question ====================  

### What is a service worker  

==================== Answer ====================  

A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the
background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web
page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich
offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic
background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and
programmatically managing a cache of responses.
