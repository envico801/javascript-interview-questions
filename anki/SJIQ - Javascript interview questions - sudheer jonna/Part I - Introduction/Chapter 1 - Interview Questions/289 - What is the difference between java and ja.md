==================== Question ====================  

### What is the difference between java and javascript  

==================== Answer ====================  

Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them.
Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is
dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments.
Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,

| Feature     | Java                           | JavaScript                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Typed       | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language                         |
| Paradigm    | Object oriented programming    | Prototype based programming                           |
| Scoping     | Block scoped                   | Function-scoped                                       |
| Concurrency | Thread based                   | event based                                           |
| Memory      | Uses more memory               | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |
