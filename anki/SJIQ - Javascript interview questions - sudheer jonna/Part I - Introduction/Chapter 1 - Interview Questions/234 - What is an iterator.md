==================== Question ====================  

### What is an Iterator  

==================== Answer ====================  

An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its
termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a `next()` method which
returns an object with two properties: `value` (the next value in the sequence)
and `done` (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).
