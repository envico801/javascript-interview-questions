Q: What is an Iterator  
A: An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a `next()` method which returns an object with two properties: `value` (the next value in the sequence) and `done` (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).
