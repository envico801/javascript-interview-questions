==================== Question ====================  

### What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging  

==================== Answer ====================  

You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is
executed and the debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will
stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining
values, you can resume the execution of code using the play button.
