### What are the options in a cookie  

==================== Answer ====================  

There are few below options available for a cookie,

1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can
   change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).

```javascript
document.cookie = 'username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC';
```

1. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the
   browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.

```javascript
document.cookie = 'username=John; path=/services';
```
