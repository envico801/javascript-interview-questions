========== Question ==========  

### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events  

========== Answer ==========  

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been
completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images,
and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole
page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).
