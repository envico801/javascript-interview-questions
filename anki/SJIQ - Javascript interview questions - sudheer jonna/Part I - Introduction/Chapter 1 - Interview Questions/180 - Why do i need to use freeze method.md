==================== Question ====================  

### Why do I need to use freeze method  

==================== Answer ====================  

In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that
are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current
context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various
languages.
