Q: What is an event queue  
A: The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.  
Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of the promise is moved into the microtask queue).  
The event queue constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event queue moves the callback into the call stack. If there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue.
