========== Question ==========  

### What is a debugger statement  

========== Answer ==========  

The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.

For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So

execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.

```javascript
function getProfile() {
    // code goes here
    debugger;
    // code goes here
}
```
