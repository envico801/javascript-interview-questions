========== Question ==========  

### What is a first class function  

========== Answer ==========  

In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means
when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to
other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a
value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions
assigned to a listener

```javascript
const handler = () => console.log('This is a click handler function');
document.addEventListener('click', handler);
```
