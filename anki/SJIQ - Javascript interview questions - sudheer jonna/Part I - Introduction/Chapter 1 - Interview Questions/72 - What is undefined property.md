### What is undefined property  

========== Answer ==========  

The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or declared but not initialized at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

```javascript
var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined

```javascript
user = undefined;
```
