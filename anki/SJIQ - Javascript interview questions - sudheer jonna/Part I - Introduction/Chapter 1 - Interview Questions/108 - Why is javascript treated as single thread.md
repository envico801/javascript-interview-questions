==================== Question ====================  

### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded  

==================== Answer ====================  

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification
does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run
parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like
java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.
