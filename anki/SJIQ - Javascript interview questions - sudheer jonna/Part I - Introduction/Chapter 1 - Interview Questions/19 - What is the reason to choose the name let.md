==================== Question ====================  

### What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword  

==================== Answer ====================  

`let` is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming
languages like **Scheme** and **Basic**. It has been borrowed from dozens of
other languages that use `let` already as a traditional keyword as close to
`var` as possible.
