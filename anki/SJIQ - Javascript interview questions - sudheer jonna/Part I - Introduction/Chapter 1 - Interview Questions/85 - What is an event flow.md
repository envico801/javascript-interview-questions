### What is an event flow  

==================== Answer ====================  

Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you
click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click
actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click
event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global
window object.  
There are two ways of event flow

1. Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
2. Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)
