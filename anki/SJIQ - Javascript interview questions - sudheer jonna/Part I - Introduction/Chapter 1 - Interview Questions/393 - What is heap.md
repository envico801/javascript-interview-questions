### What is heap  

========== Answer ==========  

Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.

Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.
