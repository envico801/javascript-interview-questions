========== Question ==========  

### What is a promise  

========== Answer ==========  

A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

```javascript
const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // promise description
});
```

The usage of a promise would be as below,

```javascript
const promise = new Promise(
    (resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("I'm a Promise!");
        }, 5000);
    },
    (reject) => {},
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
```

The action flow of a promise will be as below,
