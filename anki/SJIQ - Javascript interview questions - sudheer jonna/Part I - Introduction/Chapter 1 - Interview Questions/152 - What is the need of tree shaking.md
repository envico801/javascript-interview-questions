==================== Question ====================  

### What is the need of tree shaking  

==================== Answer ====================  

Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The
less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For
example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA
frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring
down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup
and Webpack bundlers.
