Q: What are regular expression patterns  
A: Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
1. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
1. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
1. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning
   For example, below are some use cases,
1. \\d: Used to find a digit
1. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
1. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
1. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
   For example, below are some use cases,
1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
1. n\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
