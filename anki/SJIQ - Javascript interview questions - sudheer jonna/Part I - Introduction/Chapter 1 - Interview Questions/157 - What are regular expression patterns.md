==================== Question ====================  

### What are regular expression patterns  

==================== Answer ====================  

Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters.
Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.  
   For example, below are some use cases,
   1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
   2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
   3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning  
   For example, below are some use cases,
   1. \\d: Used to find a digit
   2. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
   3. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities  
   For example, below are some use cases,
   1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
   2. n\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more
      occurrences of n
   3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one
      occurrences of n
