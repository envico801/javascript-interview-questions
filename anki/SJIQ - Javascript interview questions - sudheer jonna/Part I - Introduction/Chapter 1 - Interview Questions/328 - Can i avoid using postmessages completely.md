========== Question ==========  

### Can I avoid using postMessages completely  

========== Answer ==========  

You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your
application doesnâ€™t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party
scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your
application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.
