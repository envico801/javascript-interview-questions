Q: Can I avoid using postMessages completely  
A: You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesnâ€™t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.
