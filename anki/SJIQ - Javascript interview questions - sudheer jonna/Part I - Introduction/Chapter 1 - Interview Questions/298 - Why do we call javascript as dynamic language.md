Q: Why do we call javascript as dynamic language  
A: JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.
```javascript
let age = 50; // age is a number now
age = "old"; // age is a string now
age = true; // age is a boolean
```
