### What is the output of below code

```javascript
console.log(Math.max());
```

- 1: undefined

- 2: Infinity

- 3: 0

- 4: -Infinity  

========== Answer ==========  

Answer: 4

-Infinity is the initial comparant because almost every other value is bigger.
So when no arguments are provided, -Infinity is going to be returned.

**Note:** Zero number of arguments is a valid case.
