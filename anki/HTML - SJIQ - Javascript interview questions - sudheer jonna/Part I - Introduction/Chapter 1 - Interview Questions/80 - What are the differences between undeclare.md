| undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
| If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |
