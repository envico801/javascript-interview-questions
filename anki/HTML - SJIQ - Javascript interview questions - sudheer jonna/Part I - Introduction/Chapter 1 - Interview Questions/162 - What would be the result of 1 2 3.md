==================== Question ====================  

### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'  

==================== Answer ====================  

The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.
