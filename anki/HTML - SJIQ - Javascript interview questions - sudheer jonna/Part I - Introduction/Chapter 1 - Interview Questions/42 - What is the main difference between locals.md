==================== Question ====================  

### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage  

==================== Answer ====================  

LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.
